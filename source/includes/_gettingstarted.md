# Getting Started

To be able to use/access this API you will need to be a verified developer, please **[request a free trial](https://markable.ai/free-trial)** to get started. We'll contact you with your user credentials. If you have your credentials from us in hand already, please follow the steps below.

1. Then, [login](#user-authentication) with your user credentials.

2. Once you have logged in, you will get your `user_access_token`. With this token, get your default [client](#get-user-and-client) we have created for you.

3. Then, [authenticate](#client-authentication) your Client to get your `client_access_token`.

4. Make your first [visual search](#search). You will be using your `client_access_token` from above.

This API and documentation is currently in **private beta** - subject for modifications.
