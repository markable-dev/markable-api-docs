# Getting started.

To be able to use/access this API you will need to be a verified developer, please **[signup](https://markable.ai/signup)** to get started. We'll get back to you with your user credentials.

1. Then, login as [User](#user-authentication) with your user credentials.

2. Once you have logged in, you will get your `user_access_token`. With this token, get your default [Client](#get-user-and-client) we have created for you.

3. Then, [authenticate your Client](#client-authentication) to get your `client_access_token`.

4. Make your first visual [search](#search). You will be using your `client_access_token` from above.

This API and documentation is currently in **private beta** - subject for modifications.
