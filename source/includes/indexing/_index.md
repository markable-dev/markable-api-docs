Indexing is how we make CatalogItems available for search and our way of representing images.

We have constraints on the image sizes we index. 

1. We support `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.webp` px

2. Minimum image size = `224` px

3. Maximum image size = `3200` px

4. Maximum image memory size = `2.5 * 1024 * 1024` mb

Indexing is different from [Search](#product-search) for which the constraints are different.
