# Errors

**Markable** uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the **2xx** range indicate success, codes in the **4xx** range indicate an error due to information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a catalog item operation failed, etc.), and codes in the **5xx** range indicate an error with our servers.


## HTTP Error Codes

Code 	| Description
---- 	| -------
`400` 	| `Bad Request` - The request is invalid.
`401` 	| `Unauthorized` - The API key is wrong.
`403` 	| `Forbidden` - The specified resource is hidden for admins only.
`404` 	| `Not Found` - The specified could not be found.

`500` 	| `Internal Server Error` - We had a problem with our server. Please try again later.

## The Error Object

> **Example:** Error Object

```json
{
	"_type": "Error",
	"id": "abc",
	"code": 400,
	"detail": "Something went wrong."
}
```

> **Example:** Error Response

```json
{
	"errors": [
		{
			"_type": "Error",
			"id": "abc",
			"code": 400,
			"detail": "Something went wrong."
		}
	]
}
```

A failed request will return a list of error objects according to the [JSON API Specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/#errors).

An error object **MAY** have the following members:
