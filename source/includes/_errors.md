# Errors

In general, codes in the **2xx** range indicate success, codes in the **4xx** range indicate an error due to information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted or incorrectly formatted, a catalog item operation failed, etc.), and codes in the **5xx** range indicate an error with our servers.
