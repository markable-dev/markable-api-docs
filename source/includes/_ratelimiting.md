# Rate Limits

For have fair usage of our APIs, we have enforced rate limits to the number of search results one can perform per minute. For each client,

* If you are in a pilot phase, the current limit is **25 requests/minute**.

* Otherwise, the current limit is **60 requests/minute**.

Depending on your use casel, you can get in touch to have your limits increased.
